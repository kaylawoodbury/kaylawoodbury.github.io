            We just moved to Stockholm 2 months ago and are still learning about Sweden and things to to around or near town. <br> 
            <br>
            So far, we have enjoyed exploring the local parks and wondering around the city. 
            But we would love to learn what your favourite places are and add them to our Sweden budget list! <br> <br>
